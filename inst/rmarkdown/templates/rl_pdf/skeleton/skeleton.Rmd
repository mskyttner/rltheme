title: "Using rltheme in PDFs"
output: rltheme::rl_pdf
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,  dev = "cairo_pdf")
```

# Purpose

The purpose of this template is to show what you need to do in order to use
Lato in PDF output documents.

The main consideration is the use of `Cairo` and --- specifically -- the `cairo_pdf`
output device. It is best to set that in the `knit` chunk defaults (as seen in
the `setup` block) but you can also do that in the individual chunks as has also been
demonstrated in the "Roboto Condensed" chunk.

Make sure to include the library calls as they are here.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(rltheme)
library(ggplot2)
library(Cairo)
library(extrafont)

extrafont::loadfonts()
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Main Title", subtitle="This is a subtitle") +
  theme_rl()
```
